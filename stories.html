		<p class="tale1"><b>In 2003, Matt Harding quit his day job to embark on a journey that would lead him to more than 39 countries in seven continents.</b> Best known for a dance that looks very similar to running in place while snapping, Matt and his dance eventually attracted the attention of Stride Gum. The company then then paid Matt to travel, dance and record videos.

		Matt has danced with locals in Mulindi, Rwanda; in a narrow canyon in Petra, Jordan; on a lush hillside overlooking Machu Picchu in Peru; and in a crowded street in Tokyo, Japan, all on his sponsor's dime. Although he no longer actively updates his website, the videos live on, as does his collection of short travel stories on social media and elsewhere, and make for an entertaining and inspiring journey around the world.</p>
			
		<p class="tale1"><b>Helen Thayer became the first woman to ski solo to the North Pole, at age fifty. Along with her husky Charlie, she traversed the landscape, temperatures, and threat of polar bears.</b> At age 63, Helen walked across all 1,600 miles of the Gobi Desert. This unconventional explorer also kayaked 2,200 miles of the Amazon River and lived above the Arctic Circle, near a wolf’s den, all of which she’s written books about. Hint: You should read them!
		WHERE WILL YOU GO NEXT?
		While your travels may not be as epic in scope as these adventurous travelers, every time we leave home we open ourselves up to new opportunities and color our experiences.</p>
			
		<p class="tale1"><b><q>“People sometimes refer to me as an explorer, but I am not. Those who follow maps are adventurers, those who wrote the maps were the explorers.” – Karl Bushby</q></b>

		Karl Bushby is attempting to be the first person to completely walk an unbroken path around the world. He began his quest, known as the Goliath Expedition , in 1998 at the tip of South America and is still on the move. He hopes to reach his home in England soon, and as of 2020 he was encountering some visa obstacles, but is still committed to finishing his walking adventure. At journey’s end, he’ll have walked over 36,000 miles, through icy seas, mountains, and deserts , across four continents and two dozen countries. You can find updates on his whereabouts on his Facebook page.
